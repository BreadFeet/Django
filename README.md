This repository has one of my web applications, 'css'. <br>
This is a simple web application to learn skills of how to connect `templates` and `views.py` in Django. <br>
MVC pattern is included in this application along with Django's MVT pattern, which implements the register and login feature. 
> This app is made with `Django`, `python`, `html`, `css`.
